I was deep in the community, for years, and I'm still learning new shit. Do you think a cis person who doesn't even know any trans people wants to put in that effort? </p>\n\n<p>Also, a part of the community is super toxic and hostile, and unfortunately they're the loudest. Do you really want someone who just casually wants to understand see that part and go, \"Oh, being trans means you're an elitist hypersensitive asshole who has no ability to handle their own emotions so they're demanding I do that for them\"? </p>\n\n<p>That's what most cis kids of the internet age think of trans people, especially non-binary people, because of the internet. Yes, we definitely do have that reputation; thanks a lot tumblr crazies. When you tell people to do their own research, they're going to pay attention to what's loudest, because they're humans and that's what humans with a casual interest do. </p>\n\n<p>Being trans is hard and deeply personal. Yes. It's hard and deeply personal because society just really doesn't fucking get it when it comes to gender stuff. IT IS LITERALLY UP TO US, PERSONALLY, YES YOU, TO CHANGE THAT. </p>\n\n<p>If you leave it to the internet, your normal everyday person who just wants to know will get confused, see a bunch of crazed toxic rambling bullshit on both sides, get frustrated, label us as nuts and give the fuck up, because THEY ARE HUMAN, and THIS IS HARD. </p>\n\n<p>By 'educating' people when they ask, you are humanizing the issue. You are representing yourself. You're letting them personally know a trans person, and establishing their emotional connection to the WHOLE SUBJECT, ideally positively and <em>rationally</em>, so they will WANT to discover more on their own. You're likely the only trans person they've ever met and want a personal, insider account. Before you developed an opinion on Afghanistan vets, wouldn't you want a few personal accounts first? Or would you trust the media? </p>\n\n<p>Yes that's a lot of responsibility that you probably don't have the energy or patience to deal with because being trans is hard because society doesn't understand, and it's this big whole circle. But please, this is important, for PR. It's how humans work. </p>\n\n<p>Edit: there's nothing wrong with being too uh... Uncomfortable to personally talk about it. \"I'm really sorry, but it's a very delicate issue and I'm uncomfortable with talking about it.\" PERFECTLY ACCEPTABLE ANSWER, TO ANYTHING. EVER.

We can't have one without the other because we're talking about global change, and people need to be primed to a subject which is foreign to their hearts- more often than not in a negative way first, before it gives way to serious conversation. Comedians will talk about something until it's no longer \"funny\", then it becomes the norm. That's why people say that there is always some truth in a joke, the truth here isn't what the opinion is of that joke, the truth is the topic itself. Trans people are real and they're not going anywhere, time to start taking it seriously.

And making fun of those more privileged than yourself in ways specific to their privilege is a good way of talking about it without contemplating too much how depressing it is.  But then there's fiction in which sympathetic characters make fun of those less privileged than themselves, specifically making fun of their characteristics that make them less privileged.  And that's problematic as more people then consider it acceptable to join in with that.  But I haven't seen this film or trailer, it sounds very much like not my sort of thing at all, so I can't claim to know how sympathetic these characters are.

This is, I think, a consequence of choosing a name that was so radically different from my birth name that it took a while to fully sink in for purposes of internal monologue.  I <em>answered</em> to my name straight away, and everyone else used it, but it just took a while to be fully internalised.

The lone source of this claim is a BBC article that gives no citation. This is something that's hard to quantify, let alone in rank order for every country. There are only a few state approved surgeons and none of them back that number up. It's true that some people transition to avoid persecution for being gay, but trans people in Iran as in other conservative societies often face family rejection and limited employment prospects (sometimes turning to sex work which also carries harsh penalties), so understandably this isn't always a very attractive option. Being less hated isn't the same as being accepted.

And, far from seeing transsexualism as a means to eliminate gender variance, in most of these countries surgery/hormones are forbidden or very difficult to obtain. This puts trans people in a really precarious position, violating both gender and sexual norms (since, as you say, it's all based in genital essentialism and they're still their birth gender under that rubric). Iran is notable because it's such an exception (I think because of their unique history and politics, which we could be hopeful will lead to reforms in their treatment of gay people in the future), and even then you're not telling the full story.

While I don't doubt that it took up a large, overbearing, part of their consciousness there are two elements to consider here.    </p>\n\n<p>To begin with there is the camera. Often in film the camera acts a neutral observer, forever moving throughout the scene, yet never imposing. This is less a film, and more a documentary though. While we may be lulled into the illusion of the camera as we've come to know it, the people on the street are certainly aware of it.  </p>\n\n<p>From what we can tell in the various close up shots, the camera is not one among the camera phones we see gleefully pointed at her, but rather something large. I don't know what kind of camera they had, but its size seems to imply a certain cost, and ultimately points towards a larger audience. People love mugging in the background of news feeds; the Today show has built itself in part around this phenomenon. As such, the camera helps in part to build a crowd, not <em>just</em> her gender non-conformity. </p>\n\n<p>Another element to consider is the mask and by extension her refusal to speak. Now we can talk about the mask as signaling some kind of intersubjectivity, and the more literal reading of it simply as a mirror, and her silence perhaps as indicating in some way the larger silencing of trans voices, the silence that comes with objectification, etc. and that's all quite valid. I'm not an Art major but I have read a little into the subject and from what I can tell silence a common part of performance art, or if not silence, at least something which includes an interruption of speech as a preferred method of communication.  </p>\n\n<p>At a very immediate level, she has no face. If you really get close I guess you can say she possesses a distortion of everyone she meets as they react to her (perhaps the distorted editing plays a role in reinforcing this). In any case, she at once appears human, and yet simultaneously blocks two very fundamental elements of humanity. Indeed, there have been many characters in works of fiction who were just a talking head, or even just a voice.   </p>\n\n<p>I imagine that this is intentional. It recalls some feminist analysis of advertising where a woman's body is displayed, but her head is not, in theory removing her humanity. However, I think there are interesting effects to be noted that exist entirely outside the realm of purely sociological theories and the art world.   </p>\n\n<p>At some point I believe she falls into the <a href=\"http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/10/091013123353.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Uncanny Valley</a>. She appears human, and yet deviates in such an essential set of ways that people naturally incur a fear response, or perhaps one of disgust (reactions which appear to have an evolutionary basis). I believe that this, in small part, can help us understand the growth of the crowd and their particular reactions. Violence here is at least better understood. What's also worth noting is that it's not exactly uncommon. I remember as a child hearing others joke about hitting those performance artists who will paint themselves and dance the robot on the sidewalk. More pointedly though, there is Marina Abramovic's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marina_Abramovi%C4%87#Rhythm_0.2C_1974\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rhythm 0</a> which showed similar patterns of escalating audience aggression and fear once agency was re-established. </p>\n\n<p>It's very easy to watch a video like this and conclude, \"It's all about how people bully transpersons, and she's holding a mirror up to society.\". At some level yes, that is happening, but it's not <em>all</em> that's happening. </p>\n</div>"], "post_date": ["Fri May 1 09:28:18 2015 UTC", "last edited 15 days ago"], "score": ["2 points"], "user": ["https://www.reddit.com/user/deepsoulfunk"], "commentID": ["cquund3"]}, {"parent": [], "text": ["<div class=\"md\"><p>Stick a trigger warning on this, holy crap this stabbed my heart.

In his piece, 'Selektion' he challenged Germans perception of the holocaust and the exact role of a memorial by confronting them with the choice that had been made of who was selected to live and die. He accomplished this by presenting huge portraits of children with the accompanying word, 'Selektion'. Soon after it was put up, someone came by and slashed the portraits along their neck. This was hardly the first such memorial or anti-memorial to meet with such a display of graffiti. I saw a quote from Helnwein reacting to this where he basically said that if you're going to do public art, this kind of interaction, pro or anti social is inevitable. It's part of the process.   </p>\n\n<p>Without condoning the crowd's behavior I think this was understood and even expected by these artists.
